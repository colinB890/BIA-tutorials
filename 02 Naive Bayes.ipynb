    "\n",
    "In machine learning, na誰ve Bayes classifiers are a family of simple \"probabilistic classifiers\" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (na誰ve) independence assumptions between the features. They are among the simplest Bayesian network models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Na誰ve Bayes has been studied extensively since the 1960s. It was introduced (though not under that name) into the text retrieval community in the early 1960s, and remains a popular (baseline) method for text categorization, the problem of judging documents as belonging to one category or the other (such as spam or legitimate, sports or politics, etc.) with word frequencies as the features. With appropriate pre-processing, it is competitive in this domain with more advanced methods including support vector machines. It also finds application in automatic medical diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Bayes' theorem, the conditional probability can be decomposed as\n",
    "\n",
    "$p(C_{k}\\mid \\mathbf {x} )={\\frac {p(C_{k})\\ p(\\mathbf {x} \\mid C_{k})}{p(\\mathbf {x} )}}\\$   \n",
    "In plain English, using Bayesian probability terminology, the above equation can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$ {\\text{posterior}}={\\frac {{\\text{prior}}\\times {\\text{likelihood}}}{\\text{evidence}}}\\$  \n",
