    "\n",
    "Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a collection of statistical models and their associated estimation procedures (such as the \"variation\" among and between groups) used to analyze the differences among group means in a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA was developed by statistician and evolutionary biologist Ronald Fisher.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ANOVA setting, the observed variance in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation. In its simplest form, ANOVA provides a statistical test of whether the population means of several groups are equal, and therefore generalizes the t-test to more than two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA is useful for comparing (testing) three or more group means for statistical significance. It is conceptually similar to multiple two-sample t-tests, but is more conservative, resulting in fewer type I errors, and is therefore suited to a wide range of practical problems.\n",
